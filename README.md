# hello-world
my first repository
I want to be able to expertise in at least 2 topics or skills related to my major I followed 
I hope I can achieve this within 3 years from now on.
Then I hope I can make some oustanding, paramount milestones in my career before my 30.
I hope I can do a lot of wonderful things to my parents as soon as possible, make them proud of me.
I hope I can do all of these things above while I stay in EU or UK.
God blesses me, my grand parents bless me.
